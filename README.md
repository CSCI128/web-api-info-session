# Web Requests & APIs Info Session

Hello! This is an info session written by Ethan Richards on web requests & APIs.

Make sure to install requirements before running any files: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

Check out the following files and their examples:

`example1.py` - example of using the OpenWeatherMap API

`example2.py` - example of using the TicketMaster API

`main.py` - starter code for the Kroger API example

More examples of APIs can be found [here](https://github.com/public-apis/public-apis); The [Unsplash API](https://unsplash.com/developers) which grabs photos would be another great and easy API for beginners to work with. (Requires making an API key).
